I think it’s quite funny because I can see some semblance of truth in the tease. I’m not ashamed but don’t get me wrong — I’m not a robot, neither in social incompetence nor in quantitative genius. I do, however, attempt to model my thinking to be as systematic as a computer.</p>\n\n                            <p>Perhaps this self-made analogy of me to a computer is a concern. But I assure you I am a pretty normal person (“that’s what a computer would say”). Like normal people I enjoy running, cooking, reading, playing poker, and drinking beer, among other things. But the best way for me to convey who I am is to share some ideas. Everything I write and everything I do can be understood through how I think.</p>\n\n                            <p>For thought is a precursor to action, we first think before we act. The part of life that we can control is an amalgamation of decisions, the actions that follow, and their outcomes. So in order to make the best decisions to live the best life, we should think about the right things — precisely, what is true and what is not.</p>\n\n                            <p>To seek truth is to identify the truth from non-truth and to grab ahold of it. Over time, we start to collect these truths, like collecting Legos as a kid. And once we have enough of these truths we can build a value system. Think about a truth as a Lego brick and a value system as a Lego house. As time goes on we collect better bricks. A good person will remodel their house — replace old, worn-out pieces of the house with newer, better pieces. A bad person with no self-worth will take a sledgehammer and tear down their own house and proceed to not repair it. Sounds silly, but we all damage our house at some point or another.</p>\n                            \n                            <p>With values we begin to form ideas of what we want, as our values belie what we want. For instance, if one values financial security then they might want to be an engineer or a doctor. If one values glamour then they might want to be an actor or an actress. The point is: our value system generates goals. However, to identify what we aim at is not so simple. The examples I used are grossly oversimplified. Most of us value financial security, but that doesn’t pigeonhole us to aim at being an engineer or a doctor; and likewise, those who crave attention do not have to be an actor or an actress. </p>\n\n                            <p>Values can be categorized. The range of values include money, social relationships, attention, self-satisfaction, approval from others, and so on.</p>\n\n                            <p>One person may value a particular value more than another person values the same value. Each person has different weights for each value. If values are quantified, a goal is simply the highest result of the sum of weighted values.</p>\n\n                            <p>This framework can attempt to explain differences between people. Each person collects their own truths and these truths are used to build their own value system. People have different weights for each value and therefore have different goals. </p>\n                                \n                            <p>Now, with defined goals we can proceed to make decisions to achieve them. Goals are an aggregation of smaller goals. Our minds automatically begin to disaggregate our big goals into smaller ones, or recall the smaller goals that led to the formation of the big goal. To which comes to mind first, the bigger goal or the smaller goals which constitute the bigger, is unclear to me. Regardless to which, our minds attempt to define a roadmap of where we desire to go. </p>\n\n                            <p>There is not just one possible way to achieve a given goal. There are infinitely many possible maps and we somehow try to select the best one. This is a daunting task that has tremendous inherent pressure. For even if we are aiming at a good goal, if we use a bad map we will fail. A roadmap which I am describing is a well-planned sequence of actions and their outcomes which result in a goal. </p>\n\n                            <p>Whereas the collection of values and selection of goals distinguishes the morally good from the bad, this process of map making further separates — but does not necessarily distinguish — the successful from the not. This is where the bulk of one’s intelligence is put to use.</p>\n\n                            <p>Just as goals are embedded with smaller goals, big roadmaps are embedded with smaller roadmaps. Drawing a map is difficult and mystifying because we do not know the future. It is impossible to know the outcomes of a given action with certainty. We can only predict the probabilities of possible outcomes. Thus, drawing a map, and furthermore piecing maps together in an efficient orientation to comprise a bigger map, is one incomprehensible calculation. It is simultaneously an abstraction and a logical formulation of events that have yet to happen. The roadmap is drawn by the general and the troops follow the roadmap — and so proceeds action.</p>\n\n                            <p>Action is merely execution. Only those who are willful can traverse the roadmaps to completion. And thus, individual will distinguishes the successful from the not. </p>\n\n                            <p>Of course, our actions do not always yield the highest probability outcomes, for a plan is just a series of expectations. So when the unexpected occurs it is our responsibility to take note of it, to understand the truths which underlie the outcome, and to alter our value system accordingly. We grow through iteration and inculcation. And this is how we live.</p>\n\n                            <p>What I have just described is the barebones structure of how I believe we all think. Our truths compose our value system; our value system determines what we want; we achieve what we want through deliberate calculation in planning actions; and then we execute such actions. There is a good chance this simply reinforced what you knew; I just put it into words you could see, to remind you. By focusing on this compartmentalized structure you can begin to understand <i>why</i> things are the way they are, and <i>why</i> we do what we do.</p>\n\n                            <p>So now, more about me.</p>\n\n                            <p>I cook because cooking is a miniature model of how we live. To cook you must collect truths about cooking, such as the internal temperature of a medium-rare steak or what type of oil is best for stir-frying. You use these truths to cook what you want. From there it’s just execution and learning from mistakes.</p> \n\n                            <p>I play poker not only because it’s fun but it also enhances my ability to predict unknown outcomes. Drawing roadmaps get easier as I get better at poker, and vice versa.</p>\t\n\n                            <p>I read to acquire truth.</p>\n\n                            <p>I run to build will.</p>\n\n                            <p>And I drink beer because, well, I like beer.</p> */}\n\n                            <p>Here are the facts about me you were probably looking for:</p> \n\n                            <p>I am 21 years old.
